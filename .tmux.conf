# A) Cross-platform support, or even cross-windowing system support (e.g. `pbcopy` vs `xclip` vs `wl-copy`)
# B) when switching panes, or from a different app to terminal, it is easy
#	to accidentally trigger this without actually having a selection; e.g., the click to switch apps triggers this
#	but I was just switching apps, not making a text selection, so the buffer is empty and my clipboard suddenly
#	gets overwritten to an empty value :(
