## Notes to Self

- [My dotfiles cheatsheet](https://docs.joshuatz.com/cheatsheets/dotfiles/)
- [My Bash / Shell Scripting Cheatsheet](https://docs.joshuatz.com/cheatsheets/bash-and-shell/)
- On Linux, ZSH completions should be under `/usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix/`. On macOS, they are under `/usr/share/zsh/${version}/functions`
	- To explore with VS Code: `code "/usr/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION/functions"`
